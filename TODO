I need to do few stuff to improve this project, here is the list:

  * regen command, command that can regenerate the config of the already created vhosts,
      offering the ability to update configuation on the go, without recreating all 
      virtual host and to change virtual host configuration(ssl certificate, chroot status), when regenerating.
      
  * userban comand, command that just remove all virtual hosts from a specified user, before
      deleting the complete unix user.
